# HealthTrack

A sophisticated healthcare system, designed to collect, store, analyze, and present crucial patient's data.

It is a comprehensive solution that not only captures essential health metrics like heart rate and body temperature but also
incorporates patient-specific details through RFID cards. This amalgamation of sensor data and patient information forms the foundation upon which our system operates.

Furthermore, HealthTrack Pro Plus goes a step beyond conventional healthcare systems by
incorporating a machine learning model. This model harnesses the potential of advanced
algorithms to analyze the collected data, seeking intricate patterns and correlations. The
utilization of machine learning adds a layer of intelligence to the system, providing healthcare
professionals with actionable insights into patient health trends.
